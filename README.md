To enhance the functionality of the calculator, we can consider adding error handling and validation checks to ensure accurate calculations. Here's an updated version:

Input:
- p: Principal amount
- t: Time period in years
- r: Annual rate of interest

Output:
- Simple interest = p * t * r

1. Prompt the user to enter the principal amount (p).
2. Validate that the input is a positive number. If not, display an error message and ask for valid input.
3. Prompt the user to enter the time period in years (t).
4. Validate that the input is a positive number. If not, display an error message and ask for valid input.
5. Prompt the user to enter the annual rate of interest (r).
6. Validate that the input is a positive number. If not, display an error message and ask for valid input.
7. Calculate simple interest using the formula: simple_interest = p * t * r.
